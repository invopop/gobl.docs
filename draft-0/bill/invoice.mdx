Some regions and formats may require this field to be set.

| `corrective`  | Corrected invoice that completely *replaces* the preceding document.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `credit-note` | Reflects a refund either partial or complete of the preceding document. A  credit note effectively *extends* the previous document.                                                                                                                                                   |

| `other`       | Any other type of invoice that does not fit into the standard categories and implies that any scenarios defined in tax regimes or addons will not be applied. This is useful for being able to create invoices with custom types in extensions, but is not recommend for general use. |
