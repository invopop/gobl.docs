Todays date is used if none is set. There are often legal restrictions on how far back or in the future an invoice can be issued.                                                                                                                                                              |

Some regions and formats may require this field to be set. An empty string will be automatically updated to reflect the current time, otherwise the field can be left with a nil value.                                                     |

| `other`       | Any other type of invoice that does not fit into the standard categories and implies that any scenarios defined in tax regimes or addons will not be applied. This is useful for being able to create invoices with custom types in extensions, but is not recommend for general use. |
