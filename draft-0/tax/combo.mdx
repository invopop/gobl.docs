|-----------|-------------|-------------------------------------------|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Category  | `cat`       | [cbc.Code](/draft-0/cbc/code)             | true | Tax category code from those available inside a region.                                                                                                                     |
| Rate      | `rate`      | [cbc.Key](/draft-0/cbc/key)               |      | Rate within a category to apply.                                                                                                                                            |
