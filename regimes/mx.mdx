Mexico's tax system is administered by the SAT (Servicio de Administración
Tributaria). Electronic invoicing through CFDI (Comprobante Fiscal Digital por
Internet) version 4.0 is mandatory for all businesses.

IVA (Impuesto al Valor Agregado) applies at general, zero, and exempt rates.
Zero-rated supplies include food, medicine, and exports, while educational
and medical services are exempt.

Businesses are identified by their RFC (Registro Federal de Contribuyentes),
a 12-character code for companies or 13-character code for individuals, which
includes a date component and check digits. Every supplier and customer must
be associated with a fiscal regime code (RegimenFiscal).

CFDI invoices require specific fields including issue place (LugarExpedicion),
CFDI use (UsoCFDI), payment method (MetodoPago distinguishing between fully
paid PUE and pending PPD invoices), payment means (FormaPago), and
product/service codes (ClaveProdServ) from the SAT catalog. For B2C sales,
the simplified tag triggers use of the generic RFC code for final consumers.
For foreign customers, their country and local tax code are mapped
automatically. Invoices can include complements for fuel account balances and
food vouchers among others.
