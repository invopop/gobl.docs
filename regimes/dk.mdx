title: Denmark

Denmark's tax system is administered by the Danish Tax Agency (Skattestyrelsen).
As an EU member state, Denmark follows the EU VAT Directive.

VAT (Moms, short for Merværdiafgift) applies at a single standard rate on
most goods and services. Unlike many other EU countries, Denmark does not
have reduced VAT rates, making it one of the simplest VAT systems in Europe.
Certain supplies are zero-rated (e.g. exports, newspapers) or exempt (e.g.
healthcare, education, financial services).

Businesses are identified by their CVR number (Det Centrale Virksomhedsregister),
an 8-digit number. The Danish VAT number uses the format DK followed by the
8-digit CVR number. E-invoicing via the NemHandel/PEPPOL network is mandatory
for all B2G transactions.
