Argentina's tax system is administered by ARCA (Agencia de Recaudación
y Control Aduanero), which oversees the collection of IVA (Impuesto al
Valor Agregado), the country's value-added tax.

Taxpayers are identified using three main types of tax identification
numbers: CUIT (Clave Única de Identificación Tributaria), 11 digits
(XX-XXXXXXXX-X) used by companies and legal entities with prefixes 30,
33, and 34; CUIL (Clave Única de Identificación Laboral), 11 digits used
by individuals with prefixes 20, 27, and 23; and CDI (Clave de
Identificación) for foreign residents without CUIT/CUIL.

IVA has increased, general, and reduced rates. Argentina also
applies several retention taxes: IVA Retenido (Retained VAT) with
variable rates based on taxpayer category; Ganancias (Income Tax
Withholding) applied to payments for services; and Ingresos Brutos
(Gross Income Tax), a provincial tax with rates set by each
jurisdiction.

Electronic invoicing through ARCA is required for most transactions.
Invoices must include a CAE (Código de Autorización Electrónico) and
Point of Sale (Punto de Venta) number.

Common invoice types include Tipo A (between Responsable Inscripto
parties), Tipo B (to Monotributista or final consumer), Tipo C (from
Monotributista or exempt entities), Tipo E (exports), and Credit Notes
(Notas de Crédito).

Tax regime classifications include Responsable Inscripto (full IVA
obligations), Monotributo (simplified regime for small businesses),
Exento (exempt from IVA), and Consumidor Final (no tax ID required).
