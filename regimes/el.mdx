Greece's tax system is administered by the Independent Authority for Public
Revenue (IAPR / AADE). As an EU member state, Greece follows the EU VAT
Directive with locally adapted rates.

FPA (Fóros Prostithémenis Axías) applies at standard, reduced, and
super-reduced rates. The islands of Leros, Lesbos, Kos, Samos, and Chios
benefit from a reduction on all standard rates.

Businesses are identified by their AFM (Arithmós Forologikoú Mitróou), a
9-digit tax identification number. The Greek VAT number uses the format EL
followed by the 9-digit AFM.

Greece uses the myDATA platform for tax reporting, where invoices must be
classified with specific invoice type codes, VAT category codes, income
classifications, and exemption codes. Payment method codes must also be
reported. PEPPOL BIS Billing 3.0 is used for B2G e-invoicing. Credit notes
are supported for invoice corrections.
