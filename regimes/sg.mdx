Singapore's tax system includes a Goods and Services Tax (GST) administered
by the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (IRAS). Zero-rated supplies apply
to international services and exports. Exempt supplies include financial
services, sale and lease of residential properties, digital payment tokens,
and investment precious metals.

Businesses are identified by their Unique Entity Number (UEN). GST-registered
suppliers must display their GST Registration Number on all tax invoices,
which in most cases is the same as the UEN.

Three invoicing methods are supported: tax invoices (standard, requiring full
supplier and customer details), simplified tax invoices (for transactions
up to 1000 SGD inclusive of GST), and receipts (for non-GST-registered
customers). Credit notes are supported for correcting invoices; debit notes
in Singapore are used for requesting payment on non-GST transactions, not
for invoice corrections.
