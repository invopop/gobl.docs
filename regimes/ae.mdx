The UAE tax system is administered by the Federal Tax Authority (FTA).
VAT was introduced on January 1, 2018, with standard, zero, and
exempt rate categories.

Businesses must register for VAT if taxable supplies and imports
exceed AED 375,000 in a 12-month period, with voluntary registration
available above AED 187,500. Registered businesses receive a Tax
Registration Number (TRN) which must be included on all tax invoices.

Simplified VAT invoices may be used when the recipient is not VAT
registered, or when the transaction value does not exceed AED 10,000
for VAT-registered recipients. Credit notes are supported for
correcting invoices.
