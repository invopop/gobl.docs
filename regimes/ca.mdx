Canada's tax system is administered by the Canada Revenue Agency
(CRA). The country uses a multi-layered sales tax system consisting
of the federal Goods and Services Tax (GST) and various provincial
taxes.

The Harmonized Sales Tax (HST) combines GST and provincial sales
tax in participating provinces. Non-participating provinces levy a
separate Provincial Sales Tax (PST) at varying rates. Zero-rated
supplies include basic groceries, agricultural products, and
exports. Exempt supplies include certain financial services,
educational services, and healthcare services.

Businesses with annual taxable revenues exceeding CAD 30,000 must
register for GST/HST. Tax identification is through the Business
Number (BN) assigned by the CRA. Canada supports both credit notes
and debit notes for invoice corrections.
