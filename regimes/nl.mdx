title: The Netherlands

The Netherlands' tax system is administered by the Belastingdienst (Tax and
Customs Administration). As an EU member state, the Netherlands follows the
EU VAT Directive with locally adapted rates.

BTW (Belasting over de Toegevoegde Waarde) applies at standard and reduced
rates. The reduced rate covers food, water, pharmaceuticals, books, passenger
transport, hotel accommodation, and cultural and sporting events.

Businesses are identified by their BTW-nummer (VAT number) in the format NL
followed by 9 digits, the letter B, and 2 check digits (e.g.
NL123456789B01). The KVK (Kamer van Koophandel) number is the commercial
register number.

The Netherlands supports credit notes for invoice corrections. E-invoicing
via PEPPOL is commonly used, and is mandatory for B2G transactions with the
central government.
