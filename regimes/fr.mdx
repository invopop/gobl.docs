France's tax system is administered by the Direction Générale des Finances
Publiques (DGFiP). As an EU member state, France follows the EU VAT Directive
with locally adapted rates.

TVA (Taxe sur la Valeur Ajoutée) applies at standard, intermediate, reduced,
and super-reduced rates covering various categories of goods and services.

Businesses are identified by three closely related numbers: the VAT code
(numéro de TVA intracommunautaire), an 11-digit number starting with a
2-digit checksum followed by the 9-digit SIREN; the SIREN itself, a 9-digit
company identifier from the national register (Répertoire SIRENE); and the
SIRET, which extends the SIREN with a 5-digit establishment number to form
a 14-digit code.

France supports both corrective invoices and credit notes for invoice
corrections. E-invoicing via the Chorus Pro platform is mandatory for B2G
transactions, with B2B e-invoicing being progressively mandated through the
CTC (Continuous Transaction Controls) framework.
