applied to the purchase of goods and services. It's a tax on the value added at

follows the EU's VAT Directive, but with specific rates and exemptions tailored

### TicketBAI Product Key

Key: <code>es-tbai-product</code>	

Product keys are used by TicketBAI to differentiate between -exported- goods
and services. It may be useful to classify all products regardless of wether
they are exported or not.

There is an additional exception case for goods that are resold without modification
when the supplier is in the simplified tax regime. For must purposes this special
case can be ignored.

### TicketBAI Exemption code

Key: <code>es-tbai-exemption</code>	

Codes used by TicketBAI for both "exempt", "not-subject", and reverse
charge transactions. In the TicketBAI format these are separated,
but in order to simplify GOBL and be more closely aligned with
other countries we've combined them into one.
