title: United Kingdom

The United Kingdom's tax system is administered by His Majesty's Revenue and
Customs (HMRC). Following Brexit, the UK operates its own VAT system
independently of the EU VAT Directive.

VAT applies at standard, reduced, and zero rates. Zero-rated supplies include
food, children's clothing, books, and newspapers. Some supplies are exempt
from VAT, including financial services, education, and healthcare.
Companies are identified by their VAT Registration Number (VRN) in the format
GB followed by 9 digits, and optionally by their Company Registration Number
(CRN) from Companies House.

Northern Ireland (country code XI) has special arrangements for goods under
the Windsor Framework, remaining aligned with EU VAT rules for goods while
following UK rules for services. Credit notes are supported for invoice
corrections.
