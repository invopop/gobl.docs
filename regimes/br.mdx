Brazil uses Notas Fiscais Eletrônicas (electronic fiscal notes) such as NFSe,
NFe, and NFCe for reporting tax information to municipal, state, and federal
authorities. The tax system is administered by the Receita Federal (Federal
Revenue Service).

Tax identification is provided through a CNPJ (Cadastro Nacional da Pessoa
Jurídica) for businesses, consisting of 14 digits, or a CPF (Cadastro de Pessoas
Físicas) for individuals, consisting of 11 digits. Both types are valid for the
issuance of NFS-e (electronic service invoices).

Brazilian addresses have three subdivisions relevant for tax purposes: bairro
(neighbourhood), município (municipality), and estado (state). Municipality codes
follow the IBGE coding system.

Service notes (NFSe) let service providers document and report taxes such as
ISS (Imposto Sobre Serviços) related to the services they provide. Municipal
governments regulate them. Special tax regimes include Simples Nacional for
simplified taxation of micro and small enterprises, and MEI (Micro-Empreendedor
Individual) for individual micro-entrepreneurs.
