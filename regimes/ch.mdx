Switzerland's tax system is administered by the Federal Tax Administration
(Eidgenössische Steuerverwaltung, ESTV). Although not an EU member, Switzerland
operates its own VAT system (Mehrwertsteuer, MWST).

VAT applies at standard, reduced, and special rates. The reduced rate covers
everyday goods such as food, non-alcoholic beverages, books, newspapers, and
medicines, while a special rate applies to accommodation services.

Businesses with annual taxable revenues exceeding CHF 100,000 must register
for VAT. Tax identification uses the UID (Unternehmens-Identifikationsnummer)
in the format CHE-XXX.XXX.XXX followed by "MWST" for VAT purposes.

Switzerland supports credit notes for invoice corrections. E-invoicing is not
mandatory but is increasingly used, particularly in business-to-government (B2G)
transactions.
