# Overview

The objective that underpins GOBL, which we pronounce as "gobble", is to simplify the creation and sharing of electronic business documents so that they are easily accessible using modern standards and development techniques. Our focus initially is on invoicing.

GOBL, which we pronounce as "gobble", is a hybrid solution between a software library, a database of regional taxes and validation rules, and a set of [JSON schemas](https://json-schema.org). On one side it defines a vocabulary and structure for business documents, while at the same time providing a library written in Go to help build, validate, sign, and localise.

Throughout this documentation you'll be able to discover GOBL and how it can be used to facilitate the communication of business documents both inside and outside your organisation.

GOBL is specifically targeted at making it much easier to create business documents in a uniform fashion globally, but should be just as easy to use at a local level and provide a great alternative for many of the current standards.

It is our hope that GOBL becomes widely used and perhaps an industry standard, but in the meantime please checkout [Invopop's services](https://invopop.com) for a transformation workflow engine that can be used to convert documents into local human and alternative digital formats such as XML.

These pages are split into the following sections:

* Introduction - overview of what GOBL consists of.
* Regions - where GOBL is currently operating and implementation details.
* Document types - what can be created with GOBL.
