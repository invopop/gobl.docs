  Mappings of EN16931 Business terms and rules to GOBL properties.

terms:
  - id: BT-1
    name: "Invoice number"
    paths:
      - $.doc.series
      - $.doc.code
    notes: |-
      The document series and code are combined to form the document identifier, whereby
      the code contains a sequential number within the series.

  - id: BT-2

    name: "Invoice type code"
    paths:

    notes: |-
      GOBL defines a reduced set of basic invoice types which may be extended using
      the `$tags` property.

  - id: BT-5
    name: "Invoice currency code"
    paths:
      - $.doc.currency
    notes: |-
      The currency code is a three-letter code as defined by ISO 4217. In GOBL, if the
      currency is different from that of the tax regime of the supplier, the exchange
      rate used for conversion must also be defined.

  - id: BT-6
    name: "VAT accounting currency code"
    paths:
      - $.doc.currency
      - $.doc.exchange_rates
    notes: |-
      The VAT accounting currency code is the currency in which the VAT amounts are
      expressed. If the VAT accounting currency is different from the invoice currency,
      the exchange rate used for conversion must also be defined.

  - id: "BT-7"
    name: "Value added tax point date"
    paths:
      - $.doc.issue_date
      - $.doc.value_date
    notes: |-
      The value added tax point date is the date on which the VAT becomes due and different
      from the issue date.

  - id: "BT-8"
    name: "Value added tax point date code"

      - $.doc.ordering.code
      - $.doc.ordering.identities[*].code
      - $.doc.ordering.identities[*].ext['untdid-reference']
    notes: |-
      GOBL supports multiple identifiers. If schema is important for the identifier
      and the regular code cannot be used, assume the **first** identifier should be mapped
      to the `BT-18` term.

          GOBL uses Addons to define additional support for business contexts and formats.

      - id: "BT-24"
        name: "Specification identifier"
        paths: []
        notes: |-
          GOBL does not explicitly define a specification identifier, but it may be inferred
          from the GOBL library for conversion purposes.

  - id: "BG-4"
    name: "SELLER"
    paths:
      - $.doc.supplier
    notes: |-
      Seller details in GOBL are represented by the `supplier` property and `org.Party`
      type.

      If required, the supplier may delegate tax liability to the tax representative stored
      in the `ordering.seller` property. In this scenario, the tax regime of the document
      should be set explicitly to ensure that the correct tax calculations and regional
      requirements are met.

          Supplier UUID is designed for use with internal systems of the document issuer.
          dentifier schemes may be defined using extensions according to the standard
          in use.

          Electronic addresses are known as "inboxes" in GOBL, and may use the extensions
          property to define the Scheme Identifier.

          In EN16931 electronic endpoints have a cardinality of 0..1, but GOBL allows for
          multiple inboxes. During conversion, we assume **the first** inbox with a scheme
          and code will be used by default.

          charges with VAT rates applied.
