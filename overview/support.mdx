## Community

The complexity around invoicing and in particular electronic invoicing can quickly become overwhelming. Check out the following resources and get in touch:

- [Issues](https://github.com/invopop/gobl/issues) for specific problems with GOBL related to code or usage. Each of the projects in the [tools section](/overview/tools) will also have their own issues pages.
- [Discussions](https://github.com/invopop/gobl/discussions) for open discussions about the future of GOBL, complications with a specific country, proposals, or any open ended issues.
- [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/goblschema/shared_invite/zt-20qu1s0cm-AUE8oYbGly681EsYdDiqxw) for real-time chat about something specific or urgent. We always encourage you to use one of the others options which are indexed and searchable, but if you'd like to bring something to attentional quickly, this is a great resource.
