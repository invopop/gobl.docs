## Community

The complexity around invoicing and in particular electronic invoicing can quickly become overwhelming. Check out the following resources and get in touch:

- [Issues](https://github.com/invopop/gobl/issues) for specific problems with GOBL related to code or usage. Each of the projects in the [tools section](/overview/tools) will also have their own issues pages.
- [Discussions](https://github.com/invopop/gobl/discussions) for open discussions about the future of GOBL, complications with a specific country, proposals, or any open ended issues.
- [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/goblschema/shared_invite/zt-20qu1s0cm-AUE8oYbGly681EsYdDiqxw) when something is urgent or highly specific. We encourage you to use the other options as theyâ€™re indexed and searchable. Slack is ideal for quickly bringing something to the team's attention.
