# Builder

The [GOBL Builder](https://build.gobl.org) is a fantastic starting point for learning about how to use GOBL and testing out your documents. Follow the link and try some of the features.

You can checkout the [source code of the GOBL builder](https://github.com/invopop/gobl.builder) and even use this tool inside your own projects.

Behind the scenes, the builder uses the [GOBL CLI](https://github.com/invopop/gobl.cli) compiled using the new WASM (web assembly) frameworks for Go, so there is no server-side logic, and no data leaves your browser.
