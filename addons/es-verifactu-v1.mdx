## Extensions
### Invoice Type Code	

Code used to identify the type of invoice being sent. This will be
determined automatically by GOBL during normalization according
to the scenario definitions.

The codes `R2`, `R3`, and `R4` are not covered by GOBL's scenarios
and will need to be set manually if needed.

Values correspond to L2 list.

<Accordion title="es-verifactu-doc-type">

| Code | Name |
| ---- | ---- |
| <code>F1</code> | Invoice (Article 6, 7.2 and 7.3 of RD 1619/2012) |

### Verifactu Operation Classification/Exemption Code	

Operation classification code used to identify if taxes should be applied to the line.
VERI*FACTU makes a clear distinction between "subjected" and "exempt", while GOBL only
recognises "exempt", implying that there is simply no percentage. Mapping between the
two can thus become confusing.

GOBL will try to automatically map tax rates to operation classes, but if your
system requires needs to offer tighter control to users, it may be easier to
ask them to choose which combination of operation class and exemption code
applies to their use-case.

The following tax rates will be mapped automatically to operation classes:

| Tax Rate					| Operation Class |
|---------------------------|-----------------|
| `standard`				| `S1`            |
| `reduced`					| `S1`            |
| `super-reduced`			| `S1`            |
| `zero`					| `S1`            |
| `exempt`					| `N1`            |
| `exempt+reverse-charge`	| `S2`            |
| `exempt+export`			| `N2`            |

This extension maps to the field `CalificacionOperacion`, and cannot be
provided alongside the `es-verifactu-exempt` extension. Values correspond
to the L9 list.
