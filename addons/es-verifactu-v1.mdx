## Extensions
### Invoice Type Code	

Code used to identify the type of invoice being sent. This will be
determined automatically by GOBL during normalization according
to the scenario definitions.

The codes `R2`, `R3`, and `R4` are not covered by GOBL's scenarios
and will need to be set manually if needed.

Values correspond to L2 list.

<Accordion title="es-verifactu-doc-type">

### Verifactu Correction Type Code	

Correction type code used to identify the type of correction being
made. Values map to L3 list.

### Subject and Not Exempt Operation Class Code	

Classification code for operations that are subject to tax and not exempt, or for operations not subject to tax.

GOBL will attempt to automatically assign operation class codes based on tax key, but if your workflow requires more control, you may prefer to let users select the appropriate operation class and exemption code for each case.

Tax keys will be normalized as described in the following table. Some keys will set a default value which can be overridden.

| Tax Key          | Operation Classes    |
|------------------|----------------------|
| `standard`       | `S1`                 |
| `zero`           | `S1`                 |
| `reverse-charge` | `S2`                 |
| `outside-scope`  | `N2` (default), `N1` |
| others           | removed              |

This extension maps to the `CalificacionOperacion` field and must not be used together with the `es-verifactu-exempt` extension. Values correspond to the L9 list.

### Identity Type Code	

Identity code used to identify the type of identity document used by the customer
defined in the L7 list.

The regular Party Tax Identity is preferred over using a specific identity type
code, and will be mapped automatically as follows:

- Spanish Tax IDs will be mapped to the `NIF` field.
- EU Tax IDs will be mapped to the `IDOtro` field with code `02`.
- Non-EU Tax IDs will be mapped to the `IDOtro` field with code `04`.

VERI*FACTU will perform validation on both Spanish and EU Tax IDs, so it is important
to provide the correct details.

The following identity `key` values will be mapped automatically to an extension by the 
addon for the following keys:

| Identity Key | Extension Code |
|--------------|----------------|
| `passport`   | `03`           |
| `foreign`    | `04`           |
| `resident`   | `05`           |
| `other`      | `06`           |

The `07` "not registered in census" code is not mapped automatically, but
can be provided directly if needed.

Example identity of a UK passport:

```
{
	"identities": [
		{
			"key": "passport",
			"country": "GB",
			"code": "123456789"
		}
	]
}
```

Will be normalized to:

```
{
	"identities": [
		{
			"key": "passport",
			"country": "GB",
			"code": "123456789",
			"ext": {
				"es-verifactu-identity-type": "03"
			}
		}
	]
