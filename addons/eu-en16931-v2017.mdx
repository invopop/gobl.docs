Support for the European Norm (EN) 16931-1:2017 standard for electronic invoicing.

This addon ensures the basic rules and mappings are applied to the GOBL document
ensure that it is compliant and easily convertible to other formats.

We strongly recommend checking the output and specifically the extension codes
used to ensure that any assumptions do not need be adjusted.
