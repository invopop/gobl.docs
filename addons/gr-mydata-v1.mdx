title: Greece MyData v1.x
---

Key: <code>gr-mydata-v1</code>

Greece uses the myDATA and Peppol BIS Billing 3.0 formats for their e-invoicing/tax-reporting system.
This addon will ensure that the GOBL documents have all the required fields to be able to correctly
generate the myDATA XML reporting files.

### VAT rate	

Greece has three VAT rates: standard, reduced and super-reduced. Each of these rates are reduced by 
30% on the islands of Leros, Lesbos, Kos, Samos and Chios. The tax authority identifies each rate
with a specific VAT category.

The IAPR VAT category code must be set using the `gr-mydata-vat-rate` extension of
a line's tax to one of the codes.

| Code | Description                 | GOBL Rate              |
| ---- | --------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `1`  | Standard rate               | `standard`             |
| `2`  | Reduced rate                | `reduced`              |
| `3`  | Super-reduced rate          | `super-reduced`        |
| `4`  | Standard rate (Island)      | `standard+island`      |
| `5`  | Reduced rate (Island)       | `reduced+island`       |
| `6`  | Super-reduced rate (Island) | `super-reduced+island` |
| `7`  | Without VAT                 | `exempt`               |
| `8`  | Records without VAT         |                        |

Please, note that GOBL will automatically set the proper `gr-mydata-vat-rate` code and tax percent automatically when the line tax uses any of the GOBL rates specified in the table above. For example:

```js
{
	"$schema": "https://gobl.org/draft-0/bill/invoice",
	// ...
	"lines": [
		{
			"i": 1,
			"quantity": "20",
			"item": {
				"name": "Υπηρεσίες Ανάπτυξης",
				"price": "90.00",
			},
			"sum": "1800.00",
			"taxes": [
				{
					"cat": "VAT",
					"rate": "standard+island"
				}
			],
			"total": "1800.00"
		}
	],
}
```

| <code>2</code> | Reduced rate |
| <code>3</code> | Super-Reduced Rate |

| <code>6</code> | Super-reduced rate (Island) |
| <code>7</code> | Without VAT |

</Accordion>
### Invoice type	

The Greek tax authority (IAPR) requires an invoice type code to be specified as part of the invoice. GOBL will
automatically set the correct code based on the invoice's `type` and `$tags` values.

However, you can also set the code manually using the `gr-mydata-invoice-type` extension in the tax
section of the invoice, and setting the invoice's `type` to `other`.

The following table lists how the combination of `type` and `$tags` values are mapped to the
IAPR MyDATA invoice type code:

| Type   | Description                                     | GOBL Type     | GOBL Tags                  |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------- |----------------------------|
| `1.1`  | Sales Invoice                                   | `standard`    | `goods`                    |
| `1.2`  | Sales Invoice/Intra-community Supplies          | `standard`    | `goods`, `export`, `eu`    |
| `1.3`  | Sales Invoice/Third Country Supplies            | `standard`    | `goods`, `export`          |
| `1.4`  | Sales Invoice/Sale on Behalf of Third Parties   | `standard`    | `goods`, `self-billed`     |
| `2.1`  | Service Rendered Invoice                        | `standard`    | `services`                 |
| `2.2`  | Intra-community Service Rendered Invoice        | `standard`    | `services`, `export`, `eu` |
| `2.3`  | Third Country Service Rendered Invoice          | `standard`    | `services`, `export`       |
| `5.1`  | Credit Invoice/Associated                       | `credit-note` |                            |
| `11.1` | Retail Sales Receipt                            | `standard`    | `goods`, `simplified`      |
| `11.2` | Service Rendered Receipt                        | `standard`    | `services`, `simplified`   |
| `11.3` | Simplified Invoice                              | `standard`    | `simplified`               |
| `11.4` | Retail Sales Credit Note                        | `credit-note` | `simplified`               |
| `11.5` | Retail Sales Receipt on Behalf of Third Parties | `credit-note` | `goods`, `simplified`, `self-billed` |
			
For example, this is how you set the IAPR invoice type explicitly:

```json
{
	"$schema": "https://gobl.org/draft-0/bill/invoice",
	// ...
	"type": "other",
	"tax": {
		"ext": {
			"gr-mydata-invoice-type": "2.3"
		}
	}
}
```

And this is how you'll get the same result by using the GOBL type and tags:

```json
{
	"$schema": "https://gobl.org/draft-0/bill/invoice",
	"$addons": ["gr-mydata-v1"],
	"$tags": ["services", "export"],
	// ...
	"type": "standard",
}
```

### Payment means	

The IAPR requires invoices to specify a payment method code. In a GOBL invoice,
the payment means is set using the `key` field in the payment instructions.
The following table lists all the IAPR payment methods and how GOBL will map from
the payment instructions key to each of them:

| Code | Name                             | GOBL Payment Instruction Key |
| ---- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `1`  | Domestic Payments Account Number | `credit-transfer`            |
| `2`  | Foreign Payments Account Number  | `credit-transfer+foreign`    |
| `3`  | Cash                             | `cash`                       |
| `4`  | Check                            | `cheque`                     |
| `5`  | On credit                        | `promissory-note`            |
| `6`  | Web Banking                      | `online`                     |
| `7`  | POS / e-POS                      | `card`                       |

For example:

```js
"payment": {
	"instructions": {
		"key": "credit-transfer+foreign" // Will set the IAPR Payment Method to "2"
	}
}
```

### VAT exemption cause	

Greece invoices can be exempt of VAT for different causes and the tax authority
require a specific cause code to be provided.

In a GOBL invoice, the `rate` of a line's tax need to be set to `exempt`, and
the `ext` map's `gr-mydata-exemption` property needs to be set.

For example:

```js
"lines": [
	{
		"i": 1,
		"quantity": "20",
		"item": {
			"name": "Υπηρεσίες Ανάπτυξης",
			"price": "90.00",
		},
		"sum": "1800.00",
		"taxes": [
			{
				"cat": "VAT",
				"rate": "exempt",
				"ext": {
					"gr-mydata-exemption": "30"
				}
			}
		],
		"total": "1800.00"
	}
]
```

### Income Classification Category	

Invoices reported to the Greek tax authority via myDATA can optionally include information
about the income classification of each invoice item.

In a GOBL invoice, the `gr-mydata-income-cat` and `gr-mydata-income-type` extensions can be
set at the item level to any of the values expected by the IAPR. For example:

```json
"lines": [
	{
		"i": 1,
		"quantity": "20",
		"item": {
		"name": "Υπηρεσίες Ανάπτυξης",
		"price": "90.00",

### Other taxes category	

Certain myDATA invoice types (_e.g._, 8.2 for the accommodation tax) require a category
for other taxes to be provided. In GOBL, you can use the `gr-mydata-other-tax` extension
at charge level.

For example:

```json
"charges": [
	{
		"amount": "3.00",
		"reason": "Accommodation tax",
		"ext": {
			"gr-mydata-other-tax": "8",
