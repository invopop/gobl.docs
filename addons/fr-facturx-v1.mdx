Key: <code>fr-facturx-v1</code>

Support for the French Factur-X 1.x standard for electronic invoicing.
Factur-X is based on the European Norm (EN) 16931 and is mandatory for business-to-government
(B2G) invoices in France. This addon provides the necessary structures and validations to
ensure compliance with the Factur-X specifications.

Currently this is just a placeholder addon as the EN16931 addon will provide
all validation requirements.
