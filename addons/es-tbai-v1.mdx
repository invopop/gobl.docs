## Extensions
### TicketBAI Region Code	

Region codes are used by TicketBAI to differentiate between the different
subdivisions of the Basque Country. This is used to determine the correct
API endpoint to use when submitting documents.

<Accordion title="es-tbai-region">

| Code | Name |
| ---- | ---- |
| <code>VI</code> | Araba |
| <code>BI</code> | Bizkaia |
| <code>SS</code> | Gipuzkoa |
</Accordion>
### TicketBAI Product Key	

Product keys are used by TicketBAI to differentiate between -exported- goods
and services. It may be useful to classify all products regardless of wether
they are exported or not.

There is an additional exception case for goods that are resold without modification
when the supplier is in the simplified tax regime. For must purposes this special
case can be ignored.

If no product key is provided, the default is "services".

<Accordion title="es-tbai-product">

| Code | Name |
| ---- | ---- |
| <code>goods</code> | Delivery of goods |
| <code>services</code> | Provision of services |
| <code>resale</code> | Resale of goods without modification by vendor in the simplified regime |
</Accordion>
### TicketBAI Exemption code	

Codes used by TicketBAI for both "exempt", "not-subject", and reverse
charge transactions. In the TicketBAI format these are separated,
but in order to simplify GOBL and be more closely aligned with
other countries we've combined them into one.

The follow mappings will be made automatically by GOBL during normalization.

| Tax Key           | Exemption Codes            |
|-------------------|----------------------------|
| `exempt`          | `E1` (default), `E6`       |
| `export`          | `E2` (default), `E3`, `E4` |
| `intra-community` | `E5`                       |
