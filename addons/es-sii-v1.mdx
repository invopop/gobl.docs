### Type of Operation Outside Scope

payload:

- `other` will set the `ImportePorArticulos7_14_Otros` field.
- `location` will set the `ImporteTAIReglasLocalizacion` field.

| Key `export`   | `02`        |

### Identification Type	

Identity code used to identify the type of identity document used by the customer.

The regular Party Tax Identity is preferred over using a specific identity type code, and
will be mapped automatically as follows:

- Spanish Tax IDs will be mapped to the `NIF` field.
- EU Tax IDs will be mapped to the `IDOtro\IDType` field with code `02`.
- Non-EU Tax IDs will be mapped to the `IDOtro\IDType` field with code `04`.

SII will perform validation on both Spanish and EU Tax IDs, so it is important to provide
the correct details.

The following identity `key` values will be mapped automatically to an extension by the
addon:

| Identity Key | Code |
| ------------ | ---- |
| `passport`   | `03` |
| `foreign`    | `04` |
| `resident`   | `05` |
| `other`      | `06` |

The `07` "not registered in census" code is not mapped automatically, but can be provided
directly if needed.

Example identity of a UK passport:

```
{
	"identities": [
		{
			"key": "passport",
			"country": "GB",
			"code": "123456789"
		}
	]
}
```

Will be normalized to:

```
{
	"identities": [
		{
			"key": "passport",
			"country": "GB",
			"code": "123456789",
			"ext": {
				"es-sii-identity-type": "03"
			}
		}
	]
}
```

Maps to the field `IDOtro\IDType`. Values correspond to the L4 list.

invoice includes their fiscal details, but they are not registered for tax.

Can only be true when the invoice type (`TipoFactura`) is one of: `F1`, `F3`, `R1`, `R2`,
`R3`, or `R4`.

### Issued by Third Party or Recipient

The default value is `N` (No).

The `self-billed` tag will automatically set this extension in the invoice to `S` (Yes).

set to `S` (Yes) too.

### Product Type	

Product type code used to differentiate between goods and services for the purpose of
reporting breakdowns in the SII format.

This extension is used to determine the type of operation breakdown when generating the SII
report. When provided, the value will be used to generate the `DesgloseTipoOperacion` field,
selecting between `PrestacionServices` (provision of services) or `Entrega` (delivery of
goods).

This extension is optional; if not provided, the breakdown will use `DesgloseFactura` instead
of `DesgloseTipoOperacion`.

Doesn't map directly to any field. Used internally to structure the breakdown data.
