Support for the French Chorus Pro platform for B2G (Business-to-Government) electronic invoicing.
This addon provides the necessary structures and validations to ensure compliance with the
Chorus Pro specifications.

It requires the EN16931 addon as it expands on the European standard with French-specific
requirements for public sector invoicing.

## Extensions
### General Information Framework	

The general information framework is used to provide additional context
about the entity submitting the document. If no value is provided, it will
default to "A1" (Submission by a supplier of an invoice), the most common
use-case.

This extension's value is not deterministic, meaning that it will not be
replaced by GOBL during normalization.
