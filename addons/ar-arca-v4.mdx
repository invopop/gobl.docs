### Argentina ARCA Document Type	

Code used to identify the type of document being issued.

This can always be set directly. If not provided, GOBL will automatically determine it during
normalization based on the following rules:

Type C (Simplified Tax Scheme / Monotributo supplier): If the invoice has the
`monotax` tag set, the document type will be `11` (Invoice C), `13` (Credit Note C),
or `12` (Debit Note C).

Type A (B2B with VAT-registered customers): If the customer's `ar-arca-vat-status` extension
is one of `1` (Registered Company), `6` (Monotributo Responsible), `13` (Social Monotributista),
or `16` (Promoted Independent Worker), the document type will be `1` (Invoice A), `3` (Credit
Note A), or `2` (Debit Note A).

Type B (B2C or other scenarios): For all other cases (final consumers, foreign customers,
exempt entities, or when no customer is provided), the document type will be `6` (Invoice B),
`8` (Credit Note B), or `7` (Debit Note B).

For other document types the value must be set manually.

### Argentina ARCA Concept (Goods, services, or both)	

Code used to identify the invoice concept, indicating whether the invoice covers
goods, services, or both.

This extension is automatically determined by GOBL based on the `key` field of each
line item:

- `1` (Products): All line items have `key` set to `goods`.
- `2` (Services): All line items have `key` empty, unset, or set to any value other than `goods`.
- `3` (Products and Services): The invoice contains a mix of both goods and services.

When the concept is `2` (Services) or `3` (Products and Services), the invoice must
include an ordering period and payment terms with due dates.

<Accordion title="ar-arca-concept">

| Code | Name |
| ---- | ---- |
| <code>1</code> | Goods |
| <code>2</code> | Services |
| <code>3</code> | Goods and services |
</Accordion>
### Argentina ARCA Tax Type	

Code used to identify the type of tax applied as a charge. This is used for taxes other than
VAT that need to be included in the invoice (national taxes, provincial taxes, withholdings, etc.).

These taxes must be added as invoice charges (not in line items) with the charge `key` set
to `tax`, a `percent` value (required, amounts are not accepted), and this extension to
specify the tax type.

Example - Tax applied to invoice total:

```json
"charges": [
	{
		"key": "tax",
		"percent": "3%",
		"ext": {
			"ar-arca-tax-type": "1"
		}
	}
]
```

Example - Tax applied to a specific base:

```json
"charges": [
	{
		"key": "tax",
		"percent": "3%",
		"base": "1000.00",
		"ext": {
			"ar-arca-tax-type": "1"
		}
	}
]
```

Validation rules:

- When a charge has `key: tax`, this extension is required.
- The `percent` field is required when this extension is present.
- When using code `99` (Other), the charge `reason` field is required to describe the tax.

### Argentina ARCA VAT Rate	

Code used to identify the VAT rate applied to line items.

This extension is automatically determined by GOBL based on the tax rate key defined in
the Argentine tax regime:

- `zero` rate (0%) → code `3`
- `reduced` rate (10.5%) → code `4`
- `standard` rate (21%) → code `5`
- `increased` rate (27%) → code `6`

For the special reduced rates of 5% and 2.5%, the extension must be set manually on the
line tax as these are not covered by the standard rate keys:

- 5% → code `8`
- 2.5% → code `9`

<Accordion title="ar-arca-vat-rate">

| Code | Name |
| ---- | ---- |
| <code>3</code> | 0% |
| <code>4</code> | 10.5% |
| <code>5</code> | 21% |
| <code>6</code> | 27% |
| <code>8</code> | 5% |
| <code>9</code> | 2.5% |
</Accordion>
### Argentina ARCA Customer Identity Type	

Code used to identify the type of identity document in the customer's `identities` field.

This extension is typically only needed for B2C operations where the customer needs to
provide an identification number but does not have a tax ID. Common examples include
DNI (code `96`), passport, or provincial identity cards.

When the customer has a CUIT, CUIL, or a valid foreign tax identification number,
these should be included in the `tax_id` field instead, and this extension is not required.

Example usage for a final consumer with DNI:

```json
"customer": {
	"name": "John Doe",
	"identities": [
		{
			"code": "12345678",
			"ext": {
				"ar-arca-identity-type": "96"
			}
		}
	],
	"ext": {
		"ar-arca-vat-status": "5"
	}
}
```

### Customer VAT Status	

Code used to identify the VAT status of the customer. This extension must be included
in the customer's `ext` field when the customer is required.

GOBL will automatically normalize this value based on the customer's tax identification:

Customer without tax ID (final consumers): Defaults to `5` (Final Consumer). Also
accepts `4` (Exempt Subject), `7` (Uncategorized), `10` (VAT Exempt Law 19640),
or `15` (VAT Not Applicable).

Customer with foreign tax ID: Defaults to `9` (Foreign Customer). Also accepts
`8` (Foreign Supplier).

Customer with Argentine tax ID (CUIT/CUIL): Defaults to `1` (Registered VAT Company).
Also accepts `6` (Monotributo), `13` (Social Monotributista), `16` (Promoted Independent
Worker), `4` (Exempt Subject), `7` (Uncategorized), `10` (VAT Exempt Law 19640),
or `15` (VAT Not Applicable).

The VAT status is validated against the document type:

- Type A documents (`1`, `2`, `3`, etc.): Require VAT status `1`, `6`, `13`, or `16`.
- Type B documents (`6`, `7`, `8`, etc.): Cannot have VAT status `1`, `6`, `13`, or `16`.
- Document type `49` (Used Goods Purchase Invoice): Requires VAT status `5` (Final Consumer).
