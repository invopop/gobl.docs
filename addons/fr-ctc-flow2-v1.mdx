Key: <code>fr-ctc-flow2-v1</code>

Support for the French CTC (Continuous Transaction Control) Flow 2 B2B
e-invoicing requirements from the French electronic invoicing reform.

This addon provides the necessary structures and validations to ensure compliance
with the French CTC specifications for B2B electronic invoicing.

It requires the EN16931 addon as it extends the European standard with French-specific
requirements for the e-invoicing reform.

This addon is required for regulated invoice. This refers to invoices between two parties 
registered for VAT in France. This addon should not be used for invoices which should be reported.

Note on currency conversion (BR-FR-CO-12): When an invoice is issued in a non-EUR
currency, the gobl.ubl library will automatically handle the conversion to EUR and
present the invoice with both the original currency and EUR equivalents for tax
amounts, ensuring compliance with French accounting requirements.

### Billing Mode	

Code used to describe the billing framework of the invoice. The billing mode
indicates the nature of goods/services and the payment context.

Code prefixes indicate the invoice nature:
- "B": Goods invoice (Biens)
- "S": Services invoice
- "M": Mixed/dual invoice (goods and services that are not accessory to each other)

The numeric suffix indicates the payment type (1=deposit, 2=already paid,
4=final after down payment, 5=subcontractor, 6=co-contractor, 7=e-reporting).
